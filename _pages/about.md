Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), a Rolls-Royce Graduate Fellow at the [Rolls-Royce University Technology Center at Virginia Tech](https://rollsroyce.me.vt.edu/), as well as a Graduate Researcher in the [Computational Science Laboratory](https://csl.cs.vt.edu/).

My Ph.D. work involves physics-informed machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and optimal control. My projects are interdisciplinary, and I work with fellow computer scientists, mathematicians, and mechanical engineers to apply machine learning methods to solve real world problems using large, non-simulated datasets generated from proprietary sensor readings.
